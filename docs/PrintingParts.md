# Printing Parts

## Main parts

Many of the main parts are structural so we recommend a filled filament. Although they were specifically designed to be printable with an 0.6mm nozzle, I still recommend a 0.4mm nozzle as the parts require less post-processing. 

| Setting               | Value                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Nozzle                | 0.6mm or 0.4mm              |
| Filament              | CF or GF ABS or ASA         |
| Infill                | 25% (honeycomb)             |
| Extrusion width       | 0.6mm or 0.4mm              |
| Perimeters            | 4                           |
| Top layers            | 5                           |

## Panel Clips (feature less)

Any of the clips that don't have special features can be printed with 0.6 nozzle in vase mode for an even better snap-in feel. The following settings have been tested with ABS-GF, YMMV. Depending on your bed and toolhead size, you can print many in a batch using "Complete individual objects" setting.

| Setting               | Value                       |
| -----------           | --------------------------- |
| Nozzle                | 0.6mm                       |
| Filament              | ABS or ASA GF               |
| Infill                | none                        |
| Extrusion width       | 0.85mm forced width         |
| Perimeters            | 1 *Spiral vase mode         |

## Accent parts

Most of these parts are designed for 0.4mm nozzle. Choose a bright color to make them "pop"! 

> [!CAUTION]
> Filled filaments are ok too but I suggest you print a few tolerance test prints for your bearing stacks.

| Setting               | Value                       |
| -----------           | --------------------------- |

| Filament              | ABS or ASA (bright color)   |
| Infill                | 40% (honeycomb)             |

## Mesh parts

The parts look solid but you need to print them with your favorite breathable infill. I prefer honeycomb at 25%.

| Setting               | Value                       |
| -----------           | --------------------------- |
| Nozzle                | 0.4mm                       |
| Filament              | ABS or ASA (bright color)   |
| Infill                | 25% (honeycomb)             |
| Extrusion width       | 0.4mm                       |
